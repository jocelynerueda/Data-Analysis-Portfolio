# Welcome to my portfolio! 

Here, youâ€™ll find projects that showcase my expertise in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Through these projects, I demonstrate my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights that drive informed, data-driven decision-making across diverse industries.

## Project 1: Startup Business Sales Analysis & Inventory Management Dashboard

Developed a dynamic, cloud-based dashboard for a startup to analyze sales trends, optimize inventory management, and monitor staff costs. Created a relational database and integrated it with SQL and visualization tools to transform raw data into actionable insights.

The solution features interactive dashboards covering:

- Sales Activity: total orders, total sales, total items, average order value, top-selling items, sales by hour, orders by location, delivery vs. pickup analysis
- Inventory Management: ingredient stock levels, total and per-item ingredient costs, calculated cost per product, percentage of stock remaining
- Staff Monitoring: total staff costs, total hours worked by staff member, cost per staff member

**Tools:** SQL, Looker Studio, Google Cloud Platform (Cloud SQL for MySQL, Cloud Storage buckets, Compute instances)

**Skills:** Database design and creation, cloud database migration, data integration and automation and data visualization and dashboard development
